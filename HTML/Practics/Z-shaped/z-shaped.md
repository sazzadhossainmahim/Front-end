The premise of the Z-Layout is actually pretty simple: super-impose the letter Z on the page. Place the items that you want the reader to see first along the top of the Z. The eye will naturally follow the path of the Z, so the goal is to place your "call to action" at the end. All along the path you can include bits of information that build up to the call-to-action. Let's take a look at the diagram:


    Background separation to focus the eye movement inside the framework of our design.
    A styled logo to grab the user's attention at point #1.
    A colorful "sign up" button at point #2: this will reinforce the desired eye movement.
    A Featured Image Slider in the center of the page: this will separate the top section of the design from the bottom, and facilitate eye movement downward.
    Icons at point #3 and along the bottom axis: this will encourage "title scanning" as the eye moves to the call to action.
    A big "call to action" at point #4 - thanks to the new background separation, this feature should stand out more.
